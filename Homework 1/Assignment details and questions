Using the Music Agency Enterprise:
1. Create the DDL/DML script for the Music Database using the music1.txt file and run the
script in PostgreSQL. This file is available together with this PDF file in Sakai
2. Develop SQL solutions for the six queries specified in this assignment.

Music Agency Relational Database Schema (given to us from the professor) 
  recordingLabel(labelID, labelName, location)
  cd(cdCode, cdTitle, numberSold, year, labelID, groupCode)
  song(songCode, songTitle)
  musicalGroup(groupCode, groupName)
  artist(artistID, firstName, lastName, yearBorn)
  topCDs(cdCode, year, rating)
  composedOf (cdCode, songCode, trackNumber)
  topSongs(songCode, year, rating)
  member(groupCode, artistID, fromDate, toDate)
  writtenBy(songCode, artistID)

1.[16 points] List the artist who was born in 1989. Provide their artist ID, first name, and
last name.
Output Schema: (artist id, first name, last name)

2. [16 points] List all the songs from the ’Midnights’ CD. In your output, provide only the
song titles. Order the song titles in alphabetical order.
Output Schema: (song title)

3. [17 points] How many of ’Artist 16’s (artist ID) songs have reached #1 in the top song
ratings? Your output should be a single number.
Output Schema: (num songs)

4. [17 points] What is the average number of CDs sold per year by ’Group 10’ (group
code)? In your output, provide the year and average number of sales per year. For
example, if in 2022, ’Group 10’ had sold 3 CDs, the first CD sold 10,0000, the second
CD sold 20,000 copies, and the third CD sold 30,000 copies, your output would be (2022,
20,000). Order the sales by year in descending order. Hint : You do not need any join
operations.
Output Schema: (year, avg sales)

5. [17 points] Which ’Group 10’ (group code) CDs sold more than the average as compared
to all of ’Group 10’s CDs? List the CD titles and number sold. Order the albums in
descending order by the number sold. Hint : How can you adapt your answer from
Question 4?
Output Schema: (cd title, number sold)

6. [17 points] Find all years where Taylor Swift (with artist id = ’Artist 16’ and group code
= ’Group 10’) had multiple #1 rated hits, either CDs (recorded by Taylor Swift’s group)
or songs (written by Taylor Swift). List the year and the count of number one hits. Order
the results by year in ascending order. Hint : You will need to make simultaneous use of
artist id = ’Artist 16’ and group code = ’Group 10’.
Output Schema: (year, number one hits)
